**About:** 

The literature search is likely one of the first foundational skills youâ€™ll practice as a researcher. 
It provides you context for the significance/implication of your problem, what makes it difficult to solve, 
what has been previously done, and what approach you may be able to take. 
Many of the papers you will skim throughout your search may end up in the related works section of a future paper, 
where you will contrast them with your work. 

Conducting a literature search is hard for several reasons! 
* First, you may be starting with a broad/non-specific research prompt in a field where, at this point, 
most of the vocabulary is new to you! This may mean that simple google searches may not result in any useful papers. 
* Moreover, you may find it takes you a long time to read even single paper. 
Nonetheless, this may leave you wondering how to sift through tens to hundreds of them? 
* Lastly, even when focusing on a single paper, you may find it difficult to discern which parts of a technical paper relate to your problem and how.

Especially at the start of your Ph.D., the above difficulties are normal and expected. 
Through deliberate and guided practice, you will improve at these skills. 
In this guide, we provide you with a strategy to get you started.
