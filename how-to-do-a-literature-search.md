The literature search is likely one of the first foundational skills youâ€™ll practice as a researcher. 
It provides you **context** for the **significance/implication** of your problem, what makes it **difficult** to solve, 
what has been **previously done**, and what approach you wish to try. 
Many of the papers you will skim throughout your search may further end up in the related works section of a future paper, 
where you will contrast them with your work. 

Conducting a literature search is **hard** for several reasons! 
* First, you may be starting with a **broad/non-specific** research prompt in a field where, at this point, most of the vocabulary is new to you! This may mean that simple google searches may not result in any useful papers. 
* Moreover, you may find it takes you a **long time** to read even single paper. This may leave you wondering how to sift through tens to hundreds of them? 
* Lastly, even when focusing on a single paper, you may find it difficult to discern which **parts** of a technical paper relate to your problem and how.

Especially at the start of your Ph.D., the above difficulties are **normal** and **expected**;
through **deliberate** and **guided** practice, you will improve at these skills. 
In this guide, we provide you with a strategy to get you started.
