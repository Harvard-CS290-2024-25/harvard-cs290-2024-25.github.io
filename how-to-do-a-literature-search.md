The literature search is likely one of the first foundational skills youâ€™ll practice as a researcher. 
It provides you **context** for the **significance/implication** of your problem, what makes it **difficult** to solve, 
what has been **previously done**, and what approach you wish to try. 
Many of the papers you will skim throughout your search may further end up in the related works section of a future paper, 
where you will contrast them with your work. 

Conducting a literature search is **hard** for several reasons! 
* First, you may be starting with a **broad/non-specific** research prompt in a field where, at this point, most of the vocabulary is new to you! This may mean that simple google searches may not result in any useful papers. 
* Moreover, you may find it takes you a **long time** to read even single paper. This may leave you wondering how to sift through tens to hundreds of them? 
* Lastly, even when focusing on a single paper, you may find it difficult to discern which **parts** of a technical paper relate to your problem and how.

Especially at the start of your Ph.D., the above difficulties are **normal** and **expected**;
through **deliberate** and **guided** practice, you will improve at these skills. 
In this guide, we provide you with a strategy to get you started.


## Overview: the ins-and-outs of a literature search

Broadly, one can break the literature search into four main components. We will provide an overview for them here, and a more detailed strategy in the following section:
1. **Refining** your search criteria to better utilize search engines (e.g. Google Scholar):
 * **In:** A project statement, likely in the form of a high-level motivation and desired outcome
 * **Out:** A set of **keywords** that will lead to relevant papers in a google search
 > **Tip:** Ask colleagues/mentors familiar with your line of work for a suggested set of keywords
2. **Finding** papers
  * **In:** A set of keywords
  * **Out:** A broad, unstructured list of relevant papers
  > **Tip:** Your papers will likely come from googling key words, searching up the citation tree (i.e. what papers cited this one?), and searching down the citation tree (i.e. what papers did this one cite?). The hardest part here is being able to quickly deduce whether or not the paper is relevant at all (likely from skimming the abstract/introduction)! 
3. **Categorizing** papers:
  * **In:** A paper from your broad list of papers
  * **Out:** A categorization of how this paper relates to your project, and an idea of how much time to devote reading it
  > **Tip:** Decide whether the paper motivates your problem, solves the same problem (read for understanding), a similar problem (read for contrastive sentence), or a subproblem (read for assumptions/feasibility in your setting)? 
4. **Organizing** your literature list:
  * **In:** A set of categorized papers 
  * **Out:** An organized set of papers (i.e. grouped by topic, with succinct descriptions)
  > **Tip:** This is possibly the most underrated part! Be realistic about tracking your papers *in a way that works for you*. Try to organize so that your future self can reference this list and get the main takeaways from each paper without cognitive overload (e.g. rereading the whole paper).

## The four components, in detail

Your literature is an **active process**; as you are engaging in each component below, you should always be asking yourself **whether/how** this paper relates to your project and contribution. 

### 1. Refining your search criteria

At this first step of the literature search, you probably have a rough idea of what kind of problem setting you're in but need precision to best utilize search engines like Google Scholar. This is the part where you associate your broad question with a set of **keywords**. 

Sometimes you may stumble upon the appropriate keywords with a few minutes of searching on google;
however, often you may not. This is normal -- consider asking colleagues/mentors in the relevant field for a suggested set of keywords
(or for some keywords to avoid and why).
Even better, they may be able to recommend you some relevant papers to start with.
